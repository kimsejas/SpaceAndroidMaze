# Description
A space themed Maze Android application developed for a software development college course. Includes maze generation and maze solver algorithms. When opened, the application prompts the user to pick a maze size and generation algorithm. After maze generation is complete, the user can decide to play the maze manaully with a D-pad or automatically with one of the maze solver algorithms. When played manually, the user can navigate through the maze until the exit is found or the driver runs out of battery. When played automatically, the user can adjust the speed of the animation. Lastly, a winning or losing screen is shown with game stats such as number of steps taken versus shortest possible path or battery used.
